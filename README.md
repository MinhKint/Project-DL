# Requirements
For the moment this code has been tested only on Window, and python 3.9 and tf 2.10

# Model
Resporities contains all the models and projects I have learned and implemented.

# Classify
For basic CNN models, I will put them in the Model folder.

I will leave the remaining folders with topic names or special model types.

# Note
Although there are some models that can be pretrained, I will try to deploy and build again to gain a deeper understanding.

The models and their versions will use the same data to better understand and compare performance.
